# DHCP Scrpting Driver Plug-In

This project contains Perl scripts and related files for the Novell Identity Manager Driver for Scripting. Only Linux and UNIX are currently supported. The scripts integrate your identity vault (Novell eDirectoryâ„¢) and the Scripting Driver to automatically register users for DHCP. The scripts currently use ISC's implementation of DHCP (https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp).

We and our contributors will extend the provided scripts for more general (or more specific) use.
