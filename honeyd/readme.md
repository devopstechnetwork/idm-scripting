# Honeyd Scripting Driver Plug-In
This project contains Perl scripts and related files for the Novell Identity Manager Driver for Scripting. Only Linux and UNIX are currently supported. The scripts integrate your identity vault (Novell eDirectory™) and Scripting Driver with Honeyd (http://www.honeyd.org). Honeyd is a service that runs on 'honeypot' computers—computers intended to detect hostile program activity from viruses, malicious bots and worms. A solution can be developed in which infected computers can be automatically deregistered from the network to prevent further infection.
