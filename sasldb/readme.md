# SASLDB Scripting Driver Plug-In
This project was been started as an extension to the Scripting driver to provide synchronization for sasldb, a database for authenticating users through the SASL mechanism. For this project, Bourne shell scripts were used to interface with the sasldb command
 -line tools. For information on the SASL protocol, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer/.
