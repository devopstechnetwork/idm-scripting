# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This script implements the modify command for the external Linux/UNIX 
#   application.
#
#   The modify command is an input command.  The IDM engine sends a modify 
#   command to the subscriber to request that the external application modify
#   an entry.  The modify command must contain an ASSOCIATION element.
#
#
# VARIABLES
#
#   SRC_DN
#     Specifies the distinguished name of the entry to modify in the name
#     space of eDirectory.
#
#   CLASS_NAME
#     Specifies the base class of the entry being modified.  This attribute
#     is required for modify events.
#
#   EVENT_ID
#     Specifies an identifier to identify a particular instance of the command.
#
#   ASSOCIATION
#     Specifies the unique identifier for the entry in the external
#     application.  This element is required for modify events.
#
#   ADD_<ATTR_NAME>
#     Specifies one or more values to add to <ATTR_NAME>, where <ATTR_NAME> is
#     literally replaced by the name of the attribute being modified.
#
#   REMOVE_<ATTR_NAME>
#     Specifies one or more values to remove to <ATTR_NAME>, where <ATTR_NAME>
#     is literally replaced by the name of the attribute being modified.
#
#   REMOVE_ALL_<ATTR_NAME>
#     Instructs to remove all values associated with <ATTR_NAME>, where 
#     <ATTR_NAME> is literally replaced by the name of the attribute being 
#     modified.
#
#
# REPLY FORMAT
#
#    The receiving application should respond to the modify with a STATUS
#    and an optional STATUS_MESSAGE which can be returned for IDM engine 
#    processing and logging facilities.
#
#    The format for returning STATUS and STATUS_MESSAGE are as follows:
#
#      STATUS_<LEVEL> "<optional message>"
#
#        <LEVEL> may be one of the following values:
#        * SUCCESS
#        * WARNING
#        * ERROR
#        * RETRY
#        * FATAL
#
#      Note:  FATAL will shutdown the driver, RETRY will retry the event
#             later on.
#
